- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ParineetKaur
- ğŸ‘€ I take interest in web and app development. Alongside, I have come to develop an interest in C++ because it is fast and efficient. Because most of the major operating systems are built with C++ code, it becomes even more essential to understand.
- ğŸŒ± I'm currently immersed in learning SQL using the DBMS SQLite, exploring the art of managing and querying databases to uncover valuable insights.
