- 👋 Hi, I’m @ParineetKaur
- 👀 I take interest in web and app development. Alongside, I have come to develop an interest in C++ because it is fast and efficient. Because most of the major operating systems are built with C++ code, it becomes even more essential to understand.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Swift because it is very dynamic and also enables me to be more intereactive with developing tools.
